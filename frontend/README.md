# `Perdigueros Tweet Manager Frontend` 

Here are the instructions for Perdigueros Tweet Manager Frontend deployment:


### Prerequisites

You need npm and bower. Npm is distributed with Node.js- which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer :

https://nodejs.org/en/

You need to install git too :

https://git-scm.org/downloads



### Install the dependencies and run the frontend application

Only execute `npm start` because we have configured npm for install the bower and npm dependencies.

The `npm start`command runs the application in 8000 port too.

There is a file [/app/config.json] to configure the route API and ports of the application.
