You need npm and bower. Npm is distributed with Node.js- which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer :

You need to install git too :

https://git-scm.org/downloads



### Install the dependencies and run the frontend application

Only execute `npm start` because we have configured npm for install the bower and npm dependencies.
During the execution of the command will appear which version of the package "moment" should be installed.In this case, the version chosen is:

4) jquery#1.9.1 - 3 which resolved to 3.2.1 and is required by bootstrap#3.3.7

The `npm start`command runs the application in 8000 port too.

There is a file [/app/config.json] to configure the route API and ports of the application.
